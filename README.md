# CS Sorting Algorithms Practice

### Introduction

This repo is used as a practice to implement bubble, selection, and merge sort for a simple visualisation application. Your algorithms
will be written in sortingAlgs.py file under the the respective method names. There are various draw methods that you should call
when performing various actions throughout the algorithm.

**Python 3.10+ must be used for MAC OS users** as there is issues with the GUI not updating dynamically with older versions
of Python.
